This provides a simple web interface for screen captures, for the 
Siglent SSA3021X spectrum analyzer (SA).

It has been tested on Siglent version 1.2.9.3a software.
Other s/w versions might also work, but have not been tested.

Installation requires a telnet connection to the SA. Read the forum
on how to do that if not familiar.

To install:

a) Copy the following 9 files to a USB stick (eg the same USB stick you
   do your telnet access with):
       create_screen_image.sh
       favicon.ico
       fb2bmp
       fb2png
       fblight
       index.html
       install.sh
       nweb23f
       S99webservice.sh

b) With the USB stick mounted in the SA, and you're connected via telnet, do:

   # cd /usr/bin/siglent/usr/mass_storage/U-disk0
   # chmod 777 install.sh
   # ./install.sh

If you want to see what the install script does (it's very simple), do:
   
   # cat install.sh


After the install script runs (only takes a second), you can logout and power-cycle the SA.
After reboot you should now be able to access the web interface, via:
   http://<SA IP address>

Note the SA application consumes almost 100% of the CPU time, which makes the web interface
very slow. The web interface is significantly faster if you stop the SA first (stop sweeping).
But nobody will ever call it quick.

The web interface provides two screen images. The "dark" image, which is exactly what the
screen is showing. And a "light" image version, which can often be better for
documentation and printing. Images are PNG.

Feel free to edit the (very basic) index.html file to make it prettier. If you create
something nice, please share!
