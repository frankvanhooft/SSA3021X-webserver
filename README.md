# SSA3021X-webserver
Siglent SSA3021X Spectrum Analyzer webserver

I have one of these spectrum analyzers, and it's excellent. The only thing I miss about it is not having am inbuilt webserver to do a screencapture. By default you use a USB stick, which works fine but can be a bit slow if you need to do a lot of screen captures.

Since the 3021X was released, now there's a 3021X Plus model. That model does contain a webserver, and a touchscreen, and a bunch of other goodies. If I was buying a spectrum analyzer today, I'd buy the Plus version. It's almost the same price as the "non plus" so it's much better value. But given the unit I have, the goal was to add a screen capture, which is what this project implements.

# Telnet Access
The folks over at https://www.eevblog.com/forum/testgear/hack-of-sigllent-spectrum-analyzer-ssa3021x/ have managed to get a telnet connection. Read those posts on how to do that. 

# Simple Install
Read the file: AA Read Me First.txt for details; with a telnet connection it's pretty simple.
